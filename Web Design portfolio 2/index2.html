                    <p>In a post-apocalyptic world where humans live really long and acquire powers that make them invincible, the burden of duty for others comes at a high cost. The material and spiritual realms are colliding, resulting in a rift of chaos and human sacrifice that was never supposed to exist. Years of conflict have eventually led to the birth of a man from the spawn of the two realms. To maintain balance between the realms, the material realm's authorities began an operation to assassinate this man and put a stop to his crusade.</p>

                    <p>After the perfect society structure was established centuries later by a technology discovered after WWII, an event occurred that took away over 70% of the world population and its energy. This disaster altered human history and it became evident that the world would end sooner than expected. However, in the aftermath, a small minority of super-powered humans evolved from the survivors, introducing a new group of people into the society's structure. The world's elites are against them because they are a threat to their ideal civilization, and the only way for the world to survive is to eliminate them because there can only be one side that thrives.</p>

                    <p>Liro, the medieval-era home world of numerous races, religions, and tribes. Liro's world is separated into two regions: the Lux continent and the Tenebris continent. Despite the existence of diverse races and cultures, there is strong resentment within each race based on superiority for who gets to dominate the world. As a result of centuries of conflict, Liro has become a dangerous place. In return, the deities of Liro aided each continent by providing mortals with assistance in the form of reincarnation. For the first time in generations, the world was at peace following the bloody war against the oppressive dragon king. However, a new war preparation is waiting in the shadows.</p>

                    <p>A young man travels across the United States of America at the request of a young girl fleeing a serial killer. Stacey Hunter has experienced many ups and downs while living in Wynwood, Florida. However, by consenting to assist a sixteen-year-old girl in escaping from the estranged neighborhood serial killer "the Ghost of Wynwood," who always targets females her age group, his life turned out to be even worse than before. Along the road from Florida to Mexico, the government, the cartel, and hired thugs are relentless in their pursuit. As the journey progresses, they will learn clues to a deadly mystery that has made the young girl such a target, if they can make it out alive.</p>

                    <p>In the aftermath of the warring period in Japan, a warrior born from an assassin clan seeks redemption for his actions. Considered a child prodigy and an exceptional candidate for the sole heir to the prestigious family's legacy, his defection from his destiny rendered him a traitor and the only judgement for his action is execution. Throughout his travels in Japan, he is hunted by old friends and family as the price for breaking free from his traditionalist culture and seeking his humanity within the warrior he has always known.</p>

                    <p>A philosophical story about significant topics of human justification. A small group of superior extraterrestrial life forms has invaded the planet to judge humanity for its actions against themselves and the earth. To establish fairness, this invasion occurs in a single day and is unnoticeable to humans. They disperse over the earth in disguise to explore other lifestyles and judge the first action they witness. Following observation, there will be analysis and, finally, judgment, with just one outcome chosen from either imminent destruction or salvation.</p>
